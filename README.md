# Messaging and Communication with Python

This repository contains Python code examples for sending messages and communicating with different services.

## SMS Messaging with Twilio

The `twilio_sms.py` file contains Python code that showcases how to send SMS messages using the Twilio API. Twilio is a popular cloud communications platform that provides APIs for programmatically sending and receiving SMS messages.

In the `whatsapp.py` file, you'll find Python code that demonstrates how to send messages using the Twilio API. You have obtain your credentials same as SMS Messaging with Twilio.

## Email Messaging with SMTP

The `smtp_email.py` file demonstrates how to send email messages using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) library in Python. This code allows you to send emails programmatically using an SMTP server.

To use this code, update the variables with your SMTP server details, email credentials, recipient email address, and the content of the email message. Execute the code to send an email using the SMTP library.


*Feel free to explore the code, make any necessary modifications, and use it as a reference for integrating messaging and communication features into your Python applications.*
